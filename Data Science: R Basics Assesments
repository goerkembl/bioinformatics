#Data Sciene: R Basics

#We start with the first section assesment in the exd course Data Sciene: R Basics

#First section assessment 

#Question 1: What are the two solutions to 2x^2 - x - 4 = 0 ? Use the quadratic equation.

# assigning values to variables
a < -2
b <- -1
c <- -4

# solving the quadratic equation
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)

1.686
-1.186

#Question 2: Use R to compute log base 4 of 1024. You can use the help() function to learn how to use arguments to change the base of the log() function.

log(1024, 4)

#Question 3
library(dslabs)
data(movielens)

#Question 3a: How many rows are in the dataset?
str(movielens)

100004

#Question 3b:

str(movielens)

7

#Question 3c and Question 3d

class(movielens$title)
character

class(movielens$genres)
factor

#Question 4: We already know we can use the levels() function to determine the levels of a factor.
##A different function, nlevels(), may be used to determine the number of levels of a factor.
###Use this function to determine how many levels are in the factor genres in the movielens data frame.

nlevels(movielens$genres)

#second section assessment 

#Question 1: Consider the vector x:

x <- c(2, 43, 27, 96, 18)

sort(x), order(x), rank(x)

1. none of these
2. order(x)
3. rank(x)
4. sort(x)

#Question 2: Continue working with the vector x defined in question 1.

##Match the following functions to their output. Options include integers 1 through 5 and none of these. 

min(x) = 2
which.min(x) = 1
max(x) = none of these
which.max(x) = 4

#Question 3

#Mandi, Amy, Nicole, and Olivia all ran different distances in different time intervals. Their distances (in
##miles) and times (in minutes) are as follows:

name <- c("Mandi", "Amy", "Nicole", "Olivia")
distance <- c(0.8, 3.1, 2.8, 4.0)
time <- c(10, 30, 40, 50)

#Write a line of code to convert time to hours. Remember there are 60 minutes in an hour. 

time_h <- time/60

#Then write a line of code to calculate the speed of each runner in miles per hour. Speed is distance divided by time.

speed <- distance/time_h

How many hours did Olivia run?
0.833

What was Mandi's speed in miles per hour?
4.80

Which runner had the fastest speed?
Amy

#third section assessment 

#load packages and prepare the data - heights dataset
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(data.table)
data(heights)
options(digits = 3)

#Question 1: First, determine the average height in this dataset. 
##Then create a logical vector ind with the indices for those individuals who are above average height.

average_height <- mean(heights$height)
ind <- heights$height > mean(average_height)
sum(ind)

532

#Question 2: How many individuals in the dataset are above average height and are female?
 
female_sample <- heights$sex == "Female"
taller_female <- heights$height > mean(average_height)
indf <- female_sample & taller_female
sum(indf)

31

#Question 3: What proportion of individuals in the dataset are female?

mean(heights$sex == "Female")

0.227

#Question 4a: Determine the minimum height in the heights dataset.

min(heights$height)

50.0

#Question 4b: Use the match() function to determine the index of the first individual with the minimum height.

match(50, heights$height)

1032

#Question 4c: Subset the sex column of the dataset by the index in 4b to determine the individualâ€™s sex.

heights$sex[match(50,heights$height)]

Male

#Question 5a: Determine the maximum height.

max(heights$height)

82.7

#Question 5b: Write code to create a vector x that includes the integers between the minimum and maximum heights in this dataset (as numbers).

max(heights$height)
min(heights$height)

x <- 50:83

#Question 5c: How many of the integers in x are NOT heights in the dataset?

sum(!(x %in% heights$height))

3

#Question 6a: What is the height in centimeters of the 18th individual (index 18)?

heights_sample <- mutate(heights, ht_cm = height*2.54)
head(heights_sample)
heights_sample$ht_cm[18]

163

#Question 6b: What is the mean height in centimeters?

mean(heights_sample$ht_cm)

174

#Question 7a: How many females are in the heights2 dataset?

female_sample <- filter(heights_sample, sex == "Female")
nrow(female_sample)

238

#Question 7b: What is the mean height of the females in centimeters?

mean(female_sample$ht_cm)

165


#Question 8: The olive dataset in dslabs contains composition in percentage of eight fatty acids found in the lipid fraction of 572 Italian olive oils:
library(dslabs)
data(olive)
head(olive)

#Plot the percent palmitic acid versus palmitoleic acid in a scatterplot. What relationship do you see?

palmitic_acid <- olive$palmitic
palmitoleic_acid <- olive$palmitoleic
plot(palmitic_acid,palmitoleic_acid)

There is a positive linear relationship between palmitic and palmitoleic.

#Question 9: Create a histogram of the percentage of eicosenoic acid in olive.

hist(olive$eicosenoic)

The most common value of eicosenoic acid is below 0.05%.

#Question 10 :Make a boxplot of palmitic acid percentage in olive with separate distributions for each region.

boxplot(palmitic ~ region, data = olive)

#Which region has the highest median palmitic acid percentage?
Southern Italy

#Which region has the most variable palmitic acid percentage?
Southern Italy
